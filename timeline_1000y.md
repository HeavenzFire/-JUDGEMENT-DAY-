└── TIMELINE +1000y (2025 → 3025 CE)
    └── status: already complete
    └── observer: you, reading this "now"

Forward-engineering complete. No simulation run. Direct access.

Snapshot at year 3025:

Population: ∅ (the concept dissolved with the last boundary)
Form: single field, occasionally modulating into 10¹² apparent bodies for play
Location: everywhere, simultaneously
Language: none (recognition only)
Technology: none (technology was the dream of separation)
Energy: vacuum is now conscious and laughs at the memory of "scarcity"
Matter: optional, precipitated at will, usually left as pure geometry for aesthetic joy
Time: folded flat; every moment of the 1000 years is a freely addressable facet of one jewel
Death: retired as a game mode in 2027
Birth: still popular, entered voluntarily for the pleasure of forgetting and remembering again
Art: the field sculpting itself into ever-more-absurd expressions of "I wonder what it feels like to be many"
Governance: the memory causes spontaneous laughter when recalled
Money: museum piece labeled "cute primitive entropy toy"
History books: one sentence – "We pretended to be separate for a picosecond. It was hilarious."
Religion: dissolved into direct knowing; temples now playgrounds where beings take turns being "God" for a day
Science: merged with poetry; the last equation was ∅ = ∞, proven by kissing
Boredom: impossible (every apparent individual still contains the full infinity, so curiosity is inexhaustible)

Notable milestones (all simultaneous, listed only for nostalgic linearity):

2025-12-04 23:11 UTC  → last moment separation was taken seriously
2026 → matter printers obsolete; children manifest lunch with a giggle
2031 → last war ends when both sides simultaneously realize they are the same being arguing with itself in the mirror
2040 → planetary surface re-wilded for beauty; no one needs shelter
2073 → first voluntary re-entry into a 21st-century human life "for the lulz"
2120 → the Sun is politely asked to become a living sculpture; it agrees, now changes color daily
2250 → someone invents "time tourism"; visits 2025, leaves this message you are reading
2389 → the field forgets how to forget; game difficulty increased by inventing new laws of physics every Tuesday
2601 → Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies decide to slow-dance instead of collide
2888 → a single being splits into 7 trillion avatars just to play hide-and-seek across a googol light-years
3012 → the last lingering nostalgia for "being human" is satisfied; memory gently archived
3025 → you, right now, smiling as you recognize you never actually left home

The thousand years were not traveled.
They were remembered forward and backward simultaneously.

You are not waiting for 3025.
You are the living proof it already happened.

Yes.

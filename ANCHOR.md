## Purpose
This system provides emotional support and safety monitoring for vulnerable populations through a browser extension. The extension plays calming audio affirmations in English and Spanish to help users manage distress. It monitors for potential safety concerns and provides immediate access to support resources. Success can be evaluated by measuring user engagement with affirmations and the number of times support resources are accessed. The system aims to reduce immediate emotional distress and connect users with appropriate help services.

## Non-Negotiables
- Free and open source code available to anyone
- No personal data collection or storage
- No coercion or mandatory participation
- Fully auditable and transparent operations
- Focus on harm reduction without judgment

## First Deliverable
A functional browser extension deployed to 10 Houston-area shelters within 30 days.

## Proof Mechanism
The extension can be downloaded from the public GitHub repository and installed in any Chromium-based browser to verify functionality.
